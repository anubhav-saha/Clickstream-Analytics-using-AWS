# Clickstream-Analytics-using-AWS
In this project, we are demonstrating clickstream data analysis using AWS by simulating clickstream data generated from a website of a company like Club feast and detect the user behavior by analyzing the sequence of clicks they are making, the amount of time they are spending on the landing page and whether that leads to an order. Our goal is to help the company maximize the orders coming from the website, and to ensure that the page visit leads to an order. By analyzing visitor behavior, we can also understand their preferences and make them turn into active subscribers.
